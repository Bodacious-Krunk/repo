# Lightcord
###### Based on [Botcord](https://github.com/TeamCernodile/Botcord) by [Team Cernodile](https://github.com/TeamCernodile)
Lightcord is a visual representation of OAuth applications in Discord, helps you see how healthy your bot is doing.
(NOTE! User tokens MAY have some significant issues, I've only focused on bot accounts for now)

NOTE: The server is NOT required, but you may host it, so you can have a live demo of it for everyone else.
This product is still in alpha stage, don't expect it to be 100% perfect yet.


### Note to Discord Developers
If you don't feel comfromtable with the stylesheet being used, feel free to contact me, I'll take it down upon request.
